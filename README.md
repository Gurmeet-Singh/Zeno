# Zeno
Unofficial Zeno fork. Updated to work with current GHC. For now, I have changed it minimally just to make it run. But I might update it later.

### Instruction -
1) Make sure your cabal is up to date -
```sh
$ cabal update
```

2) Configure zeno -
```sh
$ cabal configure
```

3) Build zeno -
```sh
$ runhaskell Setup build
```

And there you go, if everything works as expected, it should build properly... :-D
